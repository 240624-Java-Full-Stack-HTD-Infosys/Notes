# Description

Angular is a framework built on TypeScript. Angular includes:

- A component-based framework to create single-page applications and scalable applications.
- A collection of well-defined libraries that include many features like routing, and client-server management etc.
- Tools to develop, build, test and deploy a front-end application.


Angular should be preferred as a front-end framework when:

1. Developing Large scale dynamic applications

   - Reusable components make it easier to build and manage complex architecture and dynamic elements.

2. Developing PWAs and SPAs

   - Progressive Web Applications (PWA): A website that is similar to a mobile app is called PWA. The goal of PWA is to blur the gap between native apps and the mobile web.

   - Single Page Application (SPA): A single page application is a web app which is built with multiple components, unlike normal web pages, SPA's are loaded only once and they improve the user experience by avoiding multiple web pages and waiting time to load the webpages.

3. Developing cross-platform applications

   - Angular web apps are compatible with both desktop and mobile.

4. You have a massive project with massive team

   - Many developers can work on the same Angular project without any maintenance and error debugging issues.
