# Implementation

### Angular Setup procedure

Step 1:  Installing node.js

- Node.js can be installed from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Step 2: npm (Node Package Manager)

- Angular and the Angular applications depend on npm packages for many features and functions.
- npm client command line interface is installed with Node.js.
- To check if the npm client is installed, the following command is run in terminal.

```properties
npm -v
```

- If the above command returns the version, then the npm client is installed.
- Windows execution policies might restrict the execution of script, for help refer [Windows Execution Polocies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.2)

Step 3: Installing Angular CLI

```properties
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

- Where -g represents global scope.
