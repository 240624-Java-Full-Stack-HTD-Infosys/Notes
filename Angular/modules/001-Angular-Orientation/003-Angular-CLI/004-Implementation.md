# Implementation

### Installing Angular CLI:

```properties
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

- All the commands in Angular CLI are executed through ng.

```properties
ng help
```
- The above command lists out all the commands with a brief description.


### Creating an Angular Project:

- Navigate to the folder where the Angular project should be created

``` properties
cd folder_path
```

- The `ng new` command is used to create a new project. 

```properties
ng new project-name
```

- The `ng serve` command is used to start a deployment server to build and serve the Angular application locally in port number 4200. The link is [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

```properties
ng serve --open
```

- The `--open` automatically loads the browser to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).
