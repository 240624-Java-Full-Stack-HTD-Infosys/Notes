# Description

## Webpack

- Webpack is a powerful module bundler.
-  A JavaScript file that  contains all the files that belong together and served to client in a response to single file request is called bundle.
-  A bundle can include JS, CSS, HTML and almost any other type of files.

The following files can be configured in webpack:

- **Entry**: The module where webpack starts.
- **Output**: The bundles created by webpack are emmited here.
- **Loaders**: Used in webpack to process more than JavaScript files.
- **Plugins**: A JavaScript object that has an apply method. This apply method is called by the webpack compiler, giving access to the entire compilation lifecycle.
