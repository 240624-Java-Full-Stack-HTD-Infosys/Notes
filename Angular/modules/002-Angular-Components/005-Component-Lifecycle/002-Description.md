# Description

- Angular Component Lifecycle is described using the Lifecycle Hooks.

## Components Life Cycle Hooks

Angular creates a component; renders it; creates and renders its children; checks it when its data-bound properties change; and destroys it before removing it from the DOM. These events are called **Lifecycle Hooks**. These Lifecycle hooks have eight different function calls which correspond to the lifecycle event. Every angular component has a life cycle event carried out in 2 different phases -  one linked to the component itself and the other linked to the children of that component.

## Eight lifecycle hooks in Angular

The below diagram illustrates the order in which the eight hooks are executed.

**constructor()** - The constructor of the component class gets executed first, before the execution of any other lifecycle hook events. If we need to inject any dependencies into the component, then the constructor is the best place to do so.

#### Lifecycle Hooks

**ngOnChanges()** - Called whenever the input properties of the component change. It returns a *SimpleChanges* object which holds any current and previous property values.

**ngOnInit()** - Called once to initialize the component and set the input properties. It initializes the component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties. 

**ngDoCheck()** - Called during all change-detection runs that Angular can't detect on its own. Also called immediately after the `ngOnChanges()` method.

**ngAfterContentInit()** - Invoked once after Angular performs any content projection into the component’s view.

**ngAfterContentChecked()** - Invoked after each time Angular checks for content projected into the component. It's called after `ngAfterContentInit()` and every subsequent `ngDoCheck()`.

**ngAfterViewInit()** - Invoked after Angular initializes the component's views and its child views.

**ngAfterViewChecked()** - Invoked after each time Angular checks for the content projected into the component. a It called after `ngAfterViewInit()` and every subsequent `ngAfterContentChecked()`.

**ngOnDestroy()** - Invoked before Angular destroys the directive or component.
