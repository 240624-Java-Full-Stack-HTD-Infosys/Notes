- Date received from the backend can not be displayed on a web page, because it is not in a readable format. The date is converted into a specific format like MM-DD-YYYY, using the `date` Pipe.
- The price of a product received from the backend is a number. The currency symbol should be added to the price while displaying the price on a website. `currency` pipe converts adds the currency symbol to the number.
- Sometimes, conversion of text from lowercase to uppercase or to title case is necessary. `lowercase`, `uppercase`, and `titlecase` pipes convert text to their respective form.
