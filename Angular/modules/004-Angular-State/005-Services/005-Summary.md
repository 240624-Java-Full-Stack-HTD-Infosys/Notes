# Summary

- Dependency injection is a programming technique where a class receives the necessary objects or dependencies from an external source instead of creating them itself. This allows for more flexible and decoupled code, as the class is not tightly coupled to specific implementations of its dependencies. Instead, dependencies can be swapped out or replaced without requiring changes to the class that uses them.
