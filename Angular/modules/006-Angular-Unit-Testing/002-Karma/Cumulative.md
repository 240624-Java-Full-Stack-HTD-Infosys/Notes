# Description

- Angular downloads and installs all the necessary files to the Angular project. When a new project is created, it is ready to be tested using Jasmine and Karma.

## Karma

Karma is a task runner for our tests. It uses a configuration file named `karma.conf.js` in order to set the startup file, the reporters, the testing framework, the browser among other things.

`karma.conf.js`:
```js
// Karma configuration file, see link for more information
// https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/config/configuration-file.html

module.exports = function (config) {
  config.set({
    basePath: '',
    frameworks: ['jasmine', '@angular-devkit/build-angular'],
    plugins: [
      require('karma-jasmine'),
      require('karma-chrome-launcher'),
      require('karma-jasmine-html-reporter'),
      require('karma-coverage'),
      require('@angular-devkit/build-angular/plugins/karma')
    ],
    client: {
      jasmine: {
        // you can add configuration options for Jasmine here
        // the possible options are listed at https://jasmine.github.io/api/edge/Configuration.html
        // for example, you can disable the random execution with `random: false`
        // or set a specific seed with `seed: 4321`
      },
      clearContext: false // leave Jasmine Spec Runner output visible in browser
    },
    jasmineHtmlReporter: {
      suppressAll: true // removes the duplicated traces
    },
    coverageReporter: {
      dir: require('path').join(__dirname, './coverage/testing'),
      subdir: '.',
      reporters: [
        { type: 'html' },
        { type: 'text-summary' }
      ]
    },
    reporters: ['progress', 'kjhtml'],
    port: 9876,
    colors: true,
    logLevel: config.LOG_INFO,
    autoWatch: true,
    browsers: ['Chrome'],
    singleRun: false,
    restartOnFileChange: true
  });
};

```

<details><summary>Real World Application</summary>

# Real-World Application

- Any application uses automation testing to make sure that the application is working before its deployed.
- In Angular, karma and jasmine are used to perform unit tests, intergrated tests and end to end tests.
</details>
<details><summary>Implementation</summary> 

# Implementation

- The following command is run to test an Angular project.

```properties
ng test
```

- The `ng test` command builds the application in the watch mode.
- It also launches the Karma test runner.

The console output:

``` console
âˆš Browser application bundle generation complete.
