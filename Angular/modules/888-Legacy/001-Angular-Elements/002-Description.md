# Description

### Angular Elements

Angular elements are used to package Angular components as custom elements, a web standard for defining new HTML elements.

- A registry is maintained by the browser to keep track of all the custom elements.
- The registry is mapped to a JavaScript class which controls the behaviour and output of the element.
- Angular elements are part of the `@angular/elements` package.
- `createCustomElement()` function is used to create a custom element.

### Advantages of using Angular Elements.

1. Code Reusability: Angular components can be used in other frameworks and libraries, such as React and Vue etc.
2. Using Angular on Serve Side: Angular which is a front-end framework can be added to the project's backend.
3. Publish parts of the Application: Angular elements can be used to develop and publish parts of an application independently.
