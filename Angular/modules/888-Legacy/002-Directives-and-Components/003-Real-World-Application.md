# Real World Application

Any common functionality can be declared in a directive and implemented anywhere in the Angular application.

The following are a few real-time examples of Angular directives.

- Autofocus on input fields
- Async email/username validators
- Autosize for textareas
- Debounce directive for input fields
- Infinite scroll
- Sticky directive (makes an element fixed position when it reaches a certain scrolling distance)
