# Real World Application

- Any front-end application uses CSS to style the application.
- Since Angular works on component-based architecture, a single Angular application contains many components.
- Each component is styled differently as per requirements by the developer.
- The title of the page can be bold and aligned in the centre, where as the navigation bar can be of different colors, and the licence info is placed at the end in small letters etc.
- All components are can be styled independently using view encapsulation.
