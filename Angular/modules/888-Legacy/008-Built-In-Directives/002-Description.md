# Description

**Directive**
- TypeScript classes that add additional behaviour to elements in Angular applications are called Directives.

Different types of Angular directives

1. Component Directives: It is the main class with `@Component` decorator and it contains details like component processing, instantiation and usage at run time.
2. Attribute Directives: directives that listen to and modify the behaviour of other HTML elements, attributes, properties, and components.
3. Structural Directives: Structural directives manipulate DOM elements, these directives start with “*”.  For example `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`.

- Some directives are predefined in Angular, these directives are called built-in directives.

Most common examples for built-in attribute directives:

- `ngClass`: used to add and remove a set of CSS classes.
- `ngStyle` : used to add and remove a set of HTML styles.
- `ngModel`: used to add two-way data binding to an HTML form element.

Most common examples of built-in structural directives:

- `ngIf`: used to conditionally create or dispose of subviews from the template.
- `ngFor`: used to repeat a node for each item in a list.
- `ngSwitch`: used for a set of directives that switch among the alternative views.
