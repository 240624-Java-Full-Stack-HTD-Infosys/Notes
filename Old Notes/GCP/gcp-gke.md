# Google Kubernetes Engine
GKE is Google Cloud's Kubernetes management service. This service offers features to assist the creation and management of Kubernetes clusters. If you are familiar with Kubernetes, there's not a lot more to it. GKE allows you to manage all of your nodes and clusters within the GCP ecosystem. Google does offer GKP Autopilot, which a hands-off operations mode that manages configuration, monitoring, and scaling of your clusters automatically without extensive setup or configuration.
