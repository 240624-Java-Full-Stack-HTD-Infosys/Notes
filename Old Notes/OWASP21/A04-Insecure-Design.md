# A04:2021 â€“ Insecure Design
Insecure design is a very broad category, and shouldn't be thought of as a prerequisite to other categories. The other items on the OWASP top 10 list are about insecure implementation. A secure design can be marred by insecure implementation, however there is no implementation that can "fix" bad design. Secure design is less about code implementations and more about making security a design focus which informs the rest of design and development.

OWASP offers some tips to guide secure design:
 - Identify business and security requirements early in the lifecycle
 - Consider where your application will be hosted and how exposed it will be
 - Treat security not as an add-on but as a core part of your application
   - This includes budgeting for all security needs right away
 - Determine application states and outcomes. Document carefully so everyone can understand the program flow as well as the result of successful and failed operations

## How to Prevent
 - Establish secure design and development processes with experienced professionals
 - Use secure design patterns
 - Use threat modeling to plan for potential concerns
 - Integrate security concerns into early design processes
 - Include "misuse" cases in your testing to look for ways users might misbehave
