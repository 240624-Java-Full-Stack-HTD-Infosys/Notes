# A06:2021 â€“ Vulnerable and Outdated Components
Security is an arms race between developers and bad actors. People are always looking for ways to bypass security, and developers are constantly working to patch vulnerabilities and secure systems. Without a good process to make sure the software and all libraries, frameworks, and environments are up-to-date you will be at risk.

## How to Prevent
 - Have a process in place to regularly scan for vulnerabilities
 - Subscribe to security bulletins for new information about vulnerabilities
 - Test compatibility of updated libraries after patching
 - Remove unused dependencies and features
 - Only obtain components from trustworthy sources, and if possible scan for tampering
