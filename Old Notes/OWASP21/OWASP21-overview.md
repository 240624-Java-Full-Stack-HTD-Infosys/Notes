# OWASP Top 10 2021
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project is a focused community of developers, engineers, and security experts that produces analysis and documentation of security risks, attacks, and failures. They produce a series called the OWASP Top 10 which is an analysis of data voluntarily reported by developers and orginizations about their code, security practices, and breeches. The top 10 list is published every few years, with the most recent having been published in 2021. 

OWASP offers cutting edge research, standards, expertise, training, and tools freely to anyone. 

## CWE - Common Weakness Ennumeration
CWEs are a community-maintained set of known vulnerabilities, exploits, and practices which lead to security failuires. These are just designations given to a wide variety of security problems. There are generally two types: root causes, and symptoms. Root causes would be CWEs like "Cryptographic Failure", while symptom CWEs might include "Denial of Service"
