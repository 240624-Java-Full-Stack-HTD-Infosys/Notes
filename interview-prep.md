## Soft skills questions
 - Tell me about yourself
   - Where my current journey started (For Kyle that's he quit his job and went back to school at 30 years old)
   - education - graduation, major/minor, and acolades
   - training/experience/employment
     - Time serving the country in the Armed services
     - charitable/nonprofit
 - personality
   - Why I like this work
   - strengths and weaknesses
   - hobbies
     - especially if this ties in to the work
     - especially if they are a feather in your cap
 - ...next step! - What happens after this interview if I succeed (And now I am eager to use my skills / and now I can't wait to put my skills to the test)

 - Where do you see yourself in five years
   - The key to this question is to not be static, to be growing and changing, and succeeding
   - On the path I'm on now, not going to quit in 1 year because my band is taking off
   - GROWTH GROWTH GROWTH
   - GOALS GOALS GOALS

 - Why do you want to work for us?
   - Not becuase of money
   - Alignment with goals!!!!!!!!! <--this is the best!
   - I can thrive here
   - opportunities available to you here


 - Conflict Resolution
   - Tell me about a time... where you were in conflict... and how you learned to be more valuable to the company because of it
     - with a co-worker
     - with your manager
     - with a client
   - The key here is to show how valuable you are, that you have learned lesssons, that you are a professional
   - If you don't have a specific story to tell, cast a wider net, and repeat until you do...
 
 - Overcoming Hurdles
   - How do you handle adversity?
   - Tell me about a time... where you had to handle something difficult
   - Once again, have you learned a lesson that would make you more valuable to the company?
     - I would seek advice
     - I would consult documentation

 - Agility/Learning
 - This is similar to the adversity question above
   - How do you deal with new technologies on the job?
     - A lot of old knowlege can be applied to new tech
     - documentation
     - prototyping/practice
     - Eagerness! - I'm always interested in learning new skills

   
 - Ethical Conundrum
 - This will often be worded to downplay the negative aspect (no one would no, a victimless crime, something small and not a big deal)
   - If you found out a fellow employee was stealing money but they insisted that no one would ever know or be harmed?
   - What if you found youself in a position where you had a conflict of interest
   - What if a client whose account you manage wants to give you a gift
   - The answer to this question is to always be ethical. 

 - What is your greatest weakness? (this is about you personally)
   - The key here is how you overcome your weakness

 - Open-ended personality question
   - Not something we can really prepare for
   - If you were reborn as someone?
   - If you were an apple product?
   - The key to this question is "Are you a psychopath?"
   - Answer with personality and don't take it too seriously
   - This is about carrying on a conversation with the interviewer
   - Probably no right or wrong answer (actually there are certainly many many wrong answers, but we won't get in to that)


 - Q/A - At the end of the interview it is likely you will be given the opportuinity to ask questions
   - Get answers to your burning questions
   - Don't put your interviewer in the position to give you bad news
   - Push questions - questions that you don't care about the answer to
     - In your opinion what separates a good developer from great developer? - Follow up: That's great because I am like that... explain how you are the great employee
     - What is the highest career attainment you might expect someone to achieve having started out as a {{job position}}?
    
Finally:
The last thing you do in an interview is: "Thank you for your time/this opportunity, name"
